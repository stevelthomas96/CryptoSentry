Some analysts suggest that the cryptocurrency is preparing for a massive rally. Related Reading: Solana To Drop Before The ‘Real Move’? Analyst Forecasts New Highs In Q3 Cardano Retests Key Resistance Following last week’s drop to the $0.70 support, Cardano is attempting to break out of a crucial resistance level to continue its rally. The cryptocurrency has surged 8.8% from Friday’s low, retesting the $0.74-$0.76 area throughout this week. Notably, ADA has been hovering between the $0.65-$0.85 price range since the Q2 market recovery, briefly losing this area during the June pullback. However, the July market pump sent the altcoin to a four-month high of $0.93, sparking bullish sentiment among investors. Since then, Cardano has been in a downtrend, attempting to break out of the descending resistance for the past two weeks. Market watcher Sebastian noted that the cryptocurrency has repeatedly retested the $0.76 zone over the past few days, suggesting that “the more it tests it, the higher the likelihood to break it.” According to the analyst, ADA must reclaim the 50-day Moving Average (MA), which has served as a strong resistance and support level and coincides with the descending resistance breakout area. Following today’s performance, the altcoin has reclaimed the 50 MA indicator and eyes a retest of the $0.76 resistance. A breakout from this level would set the stage for a retest of the next crucial area between $0.79 and $0.80. “Getting back above $0.80 would confirm the trend reversal,” Sebastian affirmed. Meanwhile, a rejection from this area could propel Cardano to retest the recent lows and risk losing its local range again. ADA Breakout Eyes 85%-120% Rally Man of Bitcoin noted ADA’s recent performance, asserting that it is “now potentially working on a small 1-2 setup.” Based on this, he suggested that “as long as the price remains above the last swing low at $0.685, wave-5 of iii should follow next.” Meanwhile, analyst Ali Martinez highlighted that the cryptocurrency has been trading within a descending channel since its December 2024 high of $1.32. According to the chart, ADA retested the channel’s upper boundary for the first time in months during the July breakout but was ultimately rejected. Reclaiming the $0.76 could propel the altcoin to the channel’s resistance, and “a breakout above $0.84 could set Cardano on a path toward $1.30.” Additionally, Martinez asserted that “ADA is showing the same price structure as the last cycle, only this time, it’s unfolding more gradually. And it feels like we’re right at the beginning of an explosive move.” Similarly, Crypto Bullet stated that Cardano has been following a pattern over this cycle. Per the chart, the cryptocurrency has been trading down for months before breaking out and reaching new local highs. Related Reading: Is Bitcoin’s Price Discovery Rally Over? This Week’s Performance May Hold The Answer Last month, the cryptocurrency broke out of its eight-month downtrend, targeting a rally toward the $1.60 area.

In July 2025, the blockchain payments giant filed for a charter to launch Ripple National Trust Bank, a limited-purpose national trust bank headquartered in New York. The goal: provide enterprise-grade custody, tokenization infrastructure, and stablecoin management—without operating as a traditional deposit-taking bank. The move includes a request for a Federal Reserve Master Account, which would allow Ripple to directly access the U.S. payment system for settlement, a leap forward in integrating crypto into traditional banking. While the bank is still awaiting final regulatory approval, the announcement has already reignited market speculation, particularly around Ripple’s native token XRP and major assets like Ethereum. Meanwhile, early-stage altcoins like MAGACOIN FINANCE are catching tailwinds from the broader surge in institutional interest. XRP Testing Key Levels as Market Eyes $3.69 Currently trading between $3.03 and $3.07, XRP recently broke out of a downward channel but is now facing resistance at $3.14 and $3.34. Technical analysts note that a clean breakout above $3.34 could trigger a move toward $3.69 or even higher, particularly if regulatory clarity continues to improve. Ripple’s proposed bank could accelerate XRP adoption by boosting institutional trust. With a dedicated infrastructure for safeguarding reserves, managing RLUSD (Ripple’s stablecoin), and facilitating cross-border payments, XRP could find itself at the center of a more regulated and scalable payment system. The bullish scenario? A legal victory combined with a banking license approval—two catalysts that could launch XRP toward new highs. Ethereum Approaches $4,000 as Bulls Take Control Ethereum is trading strong between $3,555 and $3,720. After gaining more than 40% in the past month, ETH is showing resilience amid broader market volatility. Key resistance lies at $3,881 and $4,234, and analysts remain bullish provided ETH continues to defend the $3,400 range. Ethereum stands to benefit indirectly from Ripple’s banking play as well, given the broader legitimization of tokenized infrastructure and blockchain-integrated banking services. With ETH’s growing presence in tokenized treasuries, stablecoins, and DeFi infrastructure, any movement toward regulatory clarity tends to strengthen Ethereum’s investment case. Momentum with Fresh Capital Rotation into Breakout Contenders Ripple’s growing institutional influence is prompting early investors to explore the next big opportunity—especially among projects still in presale. That shift has brought major attention to MAGACOIN FINANCE, which has recently experienced a surge in whale inflows and early staking momentum. Ripple’s Trust Bank Launch Could Fuel MAGACOIN FINANCE 22,500% Gains—Outpacing XRP Projections , according to some analysts. The project is riding the wave of rising institutional appetite with a meme-fueled narrative, early timing, and strategic accumulation that’s beginning to resemble early DOGE and SHIBA cycles. Investors seeking asymmetrical upside are watching MAGACOIN FINANCE closely as ETF-driven inflows trickle down to presale markets. Conclusion: Ripple’s Banking Play Sets the Stage Ripple’s National Trust Bank proposal isn’t just another crypto headline—it’s a signal that blockchain is entering Wall Street’s core financial architecture. If approved, it could catapult XRP and ETH to new heights—and in doing so, may fuel a new generation of breakout altcoins. MAGACOIN FINANCE is already capturing that energy, one wallet at a time.

In 2023, only 3% of respondents reported receiving any part of their salary in crypto. That figure jumped to 9.6% in 2024, as blockchain-native firms and DAOs increasingly turned to stablecoins and tokens to compensate employees and contributors. At the same time, the share of workers paid exclusively in fiat dropped from 97% to 89.1%.

The results suggest that stablecoins are no longer limited to trading pairs or DeFi use cases, but are also becoming a practical tool for payroll and international payments. USDC Adoption in Payroll Strengthened by Monthly Reserve Disclosures Crypto compensation offers several advantages, especially for globally distributed teams. Stablecoins enable faster settlement times, lower transaction fees and easier access to US dollar value in regions with banking restrictions or currency instability. The findings also point to growing confidence in USDC’s reputation for regulatory compliance and transparency, particularly after Circle, its issuer, began publishing detailed monthly reserve reports and secured access to US Treasuries. More Workers Opt to Split Salaries Between Cash and Crypto While full salary payments in crypto remain uncommon, hybrid arrangements are gaining traction. Many firms now allow employees to split their compensation between fiat and digital assets, giving workers the option to dollar-cost average into crypto markets or spend directly using Web3 wallets. Pantera’s report did not disclose regional trends, but the surge in crypto salaries is likely driven in part by Asia-based teams and contractors who rely on stablecoins for cost-effective cross-border payments. The rise of on-chain compensation also comes as more crypto-native companies formalize operations.

Recently, U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs witnessed a remarkable influx of capital, with a combined net inflow of $34.15 million on August 6. This significant event marks the second consecutive trading day of positive flows, signaling growing investor confidence in Ethereum-backed financial products. This trend highlights a crucial shift in how traditional investors are engaging with the evolving cryptocurrency landscape. What’s Driving These Ethereum ETF Inflows? This impressive surge in Ethereum ETF inflows didn’t happen by chance. Data shared by Trader T reveals that key players are actively accumulating positions. Leading the charge was BlackRock’s ETHA, which alone attracted a substantial $32.41 million in inflows. This demonstrates strong institutional appetite for regulated crypto exposure. BlackRock’s ETHA: Dominant with $32.41 million in inflows. Grayscale’s ETHE: Added $10.04 million, showing continued interest in established products. ARK 21Shares’ CETH: Contributed $0.37 million, rounding out the positive contributors. However, it wasn’t universally positive. Grayscale’s mini ETH experienced a net outflow of $8.67 million. This suggests some investors might be reallocating within their Ethereum holdings or optimizing their exposure strategies. Other ETFs reported no change in their holdings for the day, maintaining a steady stance. Understanding the Impact on ETH ETF Performance The consistent positive flow, particularly the second consecutive day of net inflows, is a strong indicator of robust ETH ETF performance . It reflects increasing comfort among institutional and retail investors with regulated vehicles for accessing Ethereum’s potential. This trend can lead to greater market stability and broader acceptance of digital assets. Why is this important? When large investment firms like BlackRock see significant inflows into their products, it often validates the underlying asset. For Ethereum, this means more capital is being directly channeled into its ecosystem, potentially boosting liquidity and market cap over time. It also signifies a maturing market where traditional finance is increasingly intertwined with decentralized technologies. How Do These Inflows Affect the Broader Crypto ETF Market? The success of U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs has ripple effects across the entire crypto ETF market . Positive performance in one segment, especially a major one like Ethereum, often inspires confidence in other digital asset products. This can pave the way for more diverse crypto ETF offerings in the future, expanding options for investors seeking exposure to various cryptocurrencies without direct ownership. This institutional embrace through ETFs helps bridge the gap between traditional finance and the volatile crypto world. It provides a regulated, accessible pathway for a wider range of investors, from large funds to individual retirement accounts, to participate in the growth of digital assets. This legitimization is crucial for the long-term health and expansion of the crypto market. The Future of Digital Asset Investment Looks Bright These recent inflows underscore a growing appetite for digital asset investment . The ability to invest in Ethereum through regulated ETF products offers significant advantages, including ease of access, liquidity, and oversight. As the market matures, we can expect to see continued innovation in financial products that cater to diverse investor needs. The transparency provided by ETF structures also builds trust. Investors can track holdings and performance easily, fostering a more informed and secure investment environment. This positive momentum for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs could be a precursor to even greater institutional adoption and innovation in the broader digital asset space. In conclusion, the substantial $34.15 million in net inflows into U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs on August 6 marks a pivotal moment. Led by BlackRock, this trend signifies robust institutional confidence and a maturing market for digital asset investments. It’s a clear signal that Ethereum, through its ETF vehicles, is firmly establishing its place in mainstream finance, promising an exciting future for the crypto market.

After a period of quiet, US spot Bitcoin ETFs have made a significant comeback. On August 6, these investment vehicles collectively saw a substantial net inflow of $91.52 million. This positive shift is particularly noteworthy as it broke a five-day streak of net outflows, signaling renewed investor confidence in the digital asset space and specifically in spot Bitcoin investment products. What Drove the Recent Bitcoin ETF Inflows? The latest data, shared by crypto analyst Trader T on X, paints a clear picture of this encouraging trend. The $91.52 million in total net inflows marks a decisive turn for Bitcoin ETF inflows . This isn’t just a small bump; it’s a significant indicator that institutional and retail interest in Bitcoin exposure through regulated channels is regaining momentum. BlackRock’s IBIT led the pack, attracting a robust $41.9 million in inflows. Bitwise’s BITB followed closely, securing $26.35 million. Grayscale’s GBTC , despite its higher fees, managed to pull in $14.5 million. Fidelity’s FBTC added $10.06 million to its coffers. VanEck’s HODL contributed with $4.08 million in inflows. Interestingly, not all funds experienced inflows. ARK Invest’s ARKB saw a net outflow of $5.37 million on the same day. However, the overall picture remains overwhelmingly positive, with the majority of major players showing strong net gains. Understanding BTC ETF Performance: A Closer Look This surge in inflows for US spot Bitcoin ETFs highlights a critical aspect of the evolving cryptocurrency market: the growing acceptance and integration of digital assets into traditional finance. Spot Bitcoin ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin’s price movements without directly holding the cryptocurrency. This convenience and regulatory oversight are key attractions for a broad range of investors, from large institutions to individual traders. The daily flow data provides a real-time pulse of market sentiment. When funds like BlackRock and Fidelity, major players in traditional finance, see consistent inflows, it suggests a broader shift towards embracing Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class. This positive BTC ETF performance can also influence broader market sentiment for Bitcoin itself, potentially leading to increased price stability or even upward momentum. What’s Next for Crypto ETF Trends? The August 6th inflows offer a glimmer of optimism, but what does this mean for future crypto ETF trends ? While one day’s data doesn’t establish a long-term pattern, it certainly provides a hopeful sign. Investors and analysts will be closely watching subsequent days’ performance to see if this trend of net inflows continues or if it was an isolated event. Continued inflows into US spot Bitcoin ETFs could indicate: Increased Institutional Adoption: More institutions might be allocating capital to Bitcoin through these regulated products. Renewed Retail Interest: Individual investors, perhaps waiting for clearer market signals, might be re-entering the market. Market Maturity: The consistent use of ETFs suggests the market is maturing and becoming more accessible. However, it is important to remember that the crypto market remains volatile. External economic factors, regulatory news, and broader market sentiment can all impact these flows. Monitoring these trends is crucial for anyone involved in digital asset investment. Conclusion: A Positive Shift for Spot Bitcoin Investment The $91.52 million net inflow into US spot Bitcoin ETFs on August 6 is a welcome development for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. It marks an end to a period of outflows and showcases renewed confidence from investors across various funds. While the journey of digital assets in traditional finance is still unfolding, this positive turn in Bitcoin ETF inflows is a strong indicator of growing interest and potential stability for the market. It underscores the increasing importance of regulated investment products in making Bitcoin accessible to a wider audience, paving the way for further mainstream adoption.

This technical retest comes as institutional momentum heats up: Satsuma Technology just raised $218 million in BTC-denominated funding, adding to a broader wave of long-term capital moving into Bitcoin. With higher lows forming since April and major players like pension funds and SBI Holdings expanding crypto exposure, the setup for a breakout toward $123K is becoming harder to ignore.

CEO Henry Elder confirmed the capital will support their plan to fuse decentralized AI infrastructure via Bittensor with a Bitcoin-native treasury strategy. Currently holding 1,126 BTC at an average entry of $115,149, Satsuma’s position is nearly break-even, reflecting firm conviction in Bitcoin’s long-term trajectory amid broader market turbulence. The raise aligns with a growing macro trend: $7.8 billion in crypto asset acquisitions were disclosed last week, with $2.7 billion flowing into Bitcoin alone.

BTC Trade Setup (Short-Term): Entry: Break above $115,000 Targets: $123,200 Stop-Loss: Below $113,800 If this triangle breakout confirms, bulls could regain control, especially if paired with renewed institutional inflows and ETF stability. Institutions Double Down on BTC In the U.S., the Michigan State Retirement System just tripled its Bitcoin ETF exposure, adding 200,000 shares of the ARK 21Shares BTC ETF to its portfolio, now valued at $11.4 million. This comes despite over $1.4 billion in outflows across U.S. ETFs last week, signaling long-term conviction. Michigan also holds $13.6 million in Grayscale’s Ethereum Trust , unchanged since 2024.

A significant wave of Ethereum accumulation is underway, with institutional players and corporate treasuries making substantial moves into the ETH market. This trend signals a maturing digital asset landscape and could have profound implications for the future of the second-largest cryptocurrency. What’s Driving This Significant Spot ETH ETFs & Treasury Inflow? Nate Geraci, the respected president of NovaDius Wealth Management (formerly The ETF Store), recently shared compelling data on X. His report highlights a remarkable trend: since early June, companies holding Ethereum in their treasuries and newly emerging spot ETH ETFs have each acquired approximately 1.6% of the total Ethereum supply. This combined effort represents a staggering 3.2% of all ETH. Such a substantial absorption of tokens by these entities is a strong indicator of growing institutional confidence. It also suggests a long-term investment perspective rather than speculative trading. This steady inflow points to a strategic move by major players to secure a significant portion of the network’s native asset. It reflects a belief in Ethereum’s foundational technology and its potential for future growth. The Impact on ETH Supply and Market Dynamics When large entities like corporate treasuries and exchange-traded funds start buying up a significant percentage of an asset, it naturally impacts the available ETH supply . Here’s why this matters: Reduced Circulating Supply: As more ETH moves into long-term holdings and ETF reserves, less of it is available for day-to-day trading on exchanges. Potential Price Pressure: A reduced supply, coupled with sustained demand, can create upward pressure on Ethereum’s price over time. This is a fundamental economic principle. Market Validation: Institutional buying provides a strong vote of confidence. It validates Ethereum as a legitimate and valuable asset class, attracting further investment from traditional finance. This ongoing accumulation acts as a powerful signal to the broader market. It suggests that major financial players are increasingly comfortable allocating capital to digital assets, especially those with strong utility like Ethereum. Who Are These Ethereum Treasuries and Why Does It Matter? The term ‘ Ethereum treasuries ‘ refers to companies that hold ETH as part of their corporate reserves, similar to how they might hold cash, gold, or other traditional assets. This practice has gained traction as more businesses recognize the potential of blockchain technology and decentralized finance. Why is this significant? Diversification: Companies are diversifying their balance sheets with digital assets. Strategic Alignment: For many, holding ETH aligns with their business strategies, particularly those involved in Web3, NFTs, or DeFi. Long-Term Horizon: These are typically not short-term speculative plays but rather long-term strategic investments, implying a belief in Ethereum’s enduring value. The emergence of spot ETH ETFs also provides a regulated and accessible pathway for traditional investors to gain exposure to Ethereum without directly owning the cryptocurrency. This bridges the gap between traditional finance and the crypto market. The Future of Institutional Ethereum Investment: What’s Next? The recent surge in institutional Ethereum accumulation, highlighted by Nate Geraci’s report, paints a clear picture: major financial players are taking Ethereum seriously. This trend is likely to continue as regulatory clarity improves and more traditional investment vehicles become available. What can we expect going forward? Continued ETF Growth: As more spot ETH ETFs launch globally, they will likely continue to absorb a significant portion of the available supply. Broader Corporate Adoption: More companies may follow suit, adding ETH to their balance sheets as a hedge against inflation or as a strategic asset. Increased Market Stability: Large, long-term institutional holdings can contribute to greater market stability by reducing volatility often associated with retail speculation. This systematic accumulation by well-funded entities underscores Ethereum’s evolving role from a niche digital asset to a recognized, investable asset class within the global financial system. It’s a testament to the network’s robust ecosystem and its potential for widespread adoption. Conclusion: A New Era for Ethereum The collective efforts of spot ETH ETFs and corporate treasuries to acquire 3.2% of the total ETH supply since June mark a pivotal moment for Ethereum. This significant Ethereum accumulation by institutional players signals a profound shift in how traditional finance views and engages with digital assets. As more of the ETH supply is locked away in long-term holdings, the stage is set for a future where institutional Ethereum plays an even more dominant role in shaping the market. This ongoing trend not only validates Ethereum’s position but also paves the way for greater stability and mainstream integration. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Q1: What is Ethereum accumulation by treasuries and spot ETH ETFs? Ethereum accumulation by treasuries refers to companies holding ETH as part of their corporate balance sheets. Spot ETH ETFs are investment funds that hold actual Ethereum, allowing traditional investors to gain exposure without directly buying and storing the cryptocurrency. Both are actively acquiring significant amounts of ETH. Q2: How much of the total ETH supply has been acquired by these entities since June? According to Nate Geraci’s report, corporate treasuries and spot ETH ETFs have each acquired approximately 1.6% of the total ETH supply, leading to a combined Ethereum accumulation of roughly 3.2%. Q3: What impact does this accumulation have on the overall ETH supply? This significant accumulation reduces the amount of ETH supply available on exchanges for trading. This can lead to increased scarcity, potentially putting upward pressure on Ethereum’s price if demand remains strong or grows. Q4: Why are companies adding Ethereum to their treasuries? Companies are adding Ethereum to their Ethereum treasuries for various reasons, including diversification of assets, strategic alignment with Web3 or blockchain initiatives, and as a long-term investment believing in Ethereum’s future growth and utility. Q5: Does this institutional interest mean Ethereum is becoming more stable? Yes, the increasing involvement of institutional Ethereum investors, particularly those with long-term holding strategies, can contribute to greater market stability. Their large, less volatile holdings can help cushion price swings often associated with retail trading. Did you find this article insightful?

With Ripple’s banking initiative nearing launch and a potential XRP ETF approval looming, the crypto landscape is primed for movement. Seasoned traders know that dips often present the best buying opportunities—especially when paired with strong catalysts. Among the altcoins gaining attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly emerged as a sleeper pick . Still in its presale stage, this low-cap project is drawing early comparisons to top performers from previous cycles. XRP’s ETF Catalyst and Bank License Fuel Buying Interest XRP has been regaining momentum as Ripple inches closer to resolving its long-running legal standoff with the U.S. SEC. A $50 million settlement is reportedly in the works, which would clear the path for institutional XRP sales. More significantly, rumors of an XRP ETF filing by BlackRock and other asset managers are ramping up. At the same time, Ripple’s push to secure a banking license is being viewed as a game-changing move. Analysts believe these developments could send XRP back toward the $3 range, with any ETF approval likely triggering a major rally akin to the Bitcoin ETF surge earlier this year. The Altcoin that Draws Early Whales Before Major Listings While large caps like XRP and ADA attract institutional buzz, MAGACOIN FINANCE is making waves in the high-ROI altcoin space. Currently in presale, the project has already recorded explosive early growth, with analysts projecting a potential 25x return if momentum continues. The MAGACOIN ecosystem is designed to blend meme coin virality with real-world utility, offering a hybrid approach that’s drawing strong community support. Investors are rushing to secure presale allocations before listings begin, citing similarities to early-stage PEPE and Shiba Inu—with a more strategic roadmap in place. ADA Still Trading Far Below All-Time Highs—But Not for Long Cardano (ADA) has seen relatively quiet price action, but under the surface, excitement is building. The upcoming Midnight airdrop—a privacy-focused sidechain—is driving renewed interest in ADA holders. Historically, major network developments like this have preceded price rallies. Despite past underperformance compared to other top ten assets, ADA remains well below its all-time high near $3.

As the market cools off, savvy investors are eyeing strategic entries before the next major leg up. With Ripple’s banking initiative nearing launch and a potential XRP ETF approval looming, the crypto landscape is primed for movement. Seasoned traders know that dips often present the best buying opportunities—especially when paired with strong catalysts. Among the altcoins gaining attention, MAGACOIN FINANCE has quietly emerged as a sleeper pick . Still in its presale stage, this low-cap project is drawing early comparisons to top performers from previous cycles. XRP’s ETF Catalyst and Bank License Fuel Buying Interest XRP has been regaining momentum as Ripple inches closer to resolving its long-running legal standoff with the U.S. SEC. A $50 million settlement is reportedly in the works, which would clear the path for institutional XRP sales. More significantly, rumors of an XRP ETF filing by BlackRock and other asset managers are ramping up.

Meanwhile, the US is making significant progress toward its mission of becoming the crypto capital of the world. Despite this ambitious plan, concerns about potential capital flight are reportedly hindering the rapid advancement of stablecoin technology within the country. China Explores Stablecoin Initiatives According to a report from the Financial Times, Hong Kong has emerged as a testing ground for cryptocurrency, particularly given the strict bans on the mainland. Recently, the territory passed legislation allowing licensed businesses to issue tokens backed by any fiat currency. However, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has taken a cautious stance, indicating that only a limited number of licenses will be issued starting next year. Related Reading: Bitcoin Insult Alert: Pro Trader Dubs HODLers ‘Idiots,’ Saylor Fires Back Policymakers in China have increasingly turned their attention to stablecoins, recognizing the growing dominance of dollar-backed tokens in the global economy. The central bank governor, Pan Gongsheng, noted in a June speech that stablecoins have “fundamentally reshaped the traditional payment landscape.” However, the Chinese government faces a delicate balancing act; while it seeks to enhance the global standing of the renminbi, it must also maintain stringent controls over its financial system. Recent discussions among financial regulators have centered on the implementation of stablecoin projects, emphasizing that any such initiative must align with China’s unique national conditions. Yet, experts have cautioned that the risks associated with capital outflows could pose significant challenges. Interest Grows In Hong Kong Rebecca Liao, CEO of Saga, a company focused on blockchain infrastructure, articulated the complexities of adopting stablecoin technology, highlighting that it cannot be completely controlled by central authorities. This concern has contributed to Hong Kong’s slower progress in developing a thriving stablecoin market, especially when compared to the rapid growth observed in the United States. The HKMA has voiced apprehensions about the potential use of stablecoins in money laundering, emphasizing the need for stability and control in its new regulatory framework. As such, initial stablecoin programs in Hong Kong are expected to focus on business-to-business applications, limiting their broader adoption. Related Reading: Is The Bitcoin Bull Run In Jeopardy? Expert Reveals Strategy’s Alleged Plan To Sell All BTC Holdings The report emphasizes that interest in stablecoins is also growing among Chinese state-owned enterprises, particularly in the context of payment and settlement solutions. Multiple state-owned companies with operations in Hong Kong are reportedly looking to apply for stablecoin licenses, although only one of China’s four major state-owned banks is expected to receive a license from the HKMA in this initial phase. The HKMA has not ruled out the possibility of approving licenses for stablecoins backed by offshore renminbi, a move that could further facilitate cross-border payments—an area of increasing importance for China.

(MHT), a company listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). This massive acquisition, facilitated through a share purchase agreement with metallurgical company RIZAP Group, Inc., positions Bakkt as the largest shareholder of MHT. Incorporating Bitcoin Into MHT’s Treasury Management Plans As announced on Wednesday, part of this transaction will see Phillip Lord, the President of Bakkt International, assume the role of Chief Executive Officer at MHT. Under his leadership, MHT plans to incorporate Bitcoin (BTC) and other digital assets into its treasury management strategy. Furthermore, Bakkt has secured the domain name www.bitcoin.jp , which, pending approval from MarushoHotta’s shareholders, is set to become the new identity for the company. In a statement, Akshay Naheta, co-CEO of Bakkt, expressed enthusiasm for the opportunity, citing Japan’s regulatory environment as a favorable landscape for developing a Bitcoin-centric business model. He emphasized the intention to collaborate closely with MHT’s team to seamlessly integrate Bitcoin into their operational and financial framework , aiming to establish MHT as a foremost Bitcoin treasury company: Japan’s regulatory environment creates an ideal platform for a Bitcoin-centered growth business. We look forward to working with MHT’s team to integrate Bitcoin into their operating and financial model and to establish MHT as a leading Bitcoin treasury company. Bakkt Faces Setbacks As Stock Drops This acquisition aligns with Bakkt’s broader strategy to enhance its Bitcoin holdings. Recently, the company announced plans to raise up to $1 billion through various securities offerings, a move that reflects a growing trend among publicly traded companies to bolster their cryptocurrency reserves. The proposed offering includes shares of Class A common stock and pre-funded warrants, with underwriters being given a 30-day option to purchase an additional 15% of the shares sold, allowing for potential over-allotments. However, the timing, size, and terms of the offering remain contingent on market conditions. Despite these ambitious initiatives, Bakkt has encountered challenges. In March 2025, the company’s stock, BKKT , experienced a significant drop of 30% following news that two major clients, including Bank of America, would not be renewing their financial agreements with Bakkt. As of this writing, BKKT’s valuation closed Wednesday’s trading session at $9.77, up 2.5% for the day. However, the stock is trading over 70% below this year’s high of $31. Looking at a longer time frame, BKKT reached a record high of $1,271 in November 2021, which is nearly a 100% gap, further highlighting the firm’s challenges in recent years.

XRP is gaining renewed interest as traders adjust positions following news of the ETF delay. Stellar recently led the charts after a breakout rally, briefly pushing past major altcoins. While these price moves get coverage, the real opportunity may lie in platforms offering lasting utility and active user rewards. Cold Wallet is gaining traction on that front. Now in Stage 16 of its presale at just $0.00942, it combines self-custody, real-world utility, and up to 100% cashback. With a launch price set at $0.3517, it gives users a 3,600% return potential. Over 682.8 million coins have already been sold. Rather than hype-based movement, Cold Wallet ($CWT) offers a working system that delivers value daily. It’s shifting focus from price watching to actual use. XRP’s Price Slips as ETF Delay Shifts Focus Elsewhere XRP’s price saw a burst of activity earlier this month, but the momentum didn’t last. The delay in launching the inverse XRP ETF until August 4, 2025, cooled off the rally. Prices briefly spiked to $0.52 before slipping back below $0.50, signaling a dip in short-term confidence. For now, XRP’s next moves depend more on regulation than innovation. XRP still holds recognition in the crypto space, but its growth is now tied to external decisions. Without strong internal developments or fresh updates, many traders are pausing. Interest is shifting to platforms that offer benefits based on user engagement rather than news. Cold Wallet stands out for this reason. While XRP’s future depends on ETF rulings, Cold Wallet is already a rewarding activity. With cashback and clear usage incentives, it offers a dependable alternative. It’s building steady traction, powered not by speculation but by function. As users look for projects offering more than just headlines, Cold Wallet is making its way to the top. Stellar Slows Down After Brief Rally Fails to Hold Stellar made waves with a massive 63% rally over the past week, briefly outperforming many other altcoins. The run was fueled by renewed interest in Stellar’s role in remittance services and increased trade volumes. However, the rally ran into resistance as prices neared $0.13. Now, many see the coin entering a sideways consolidation phase, suggesting that the move may have peaked. Even with fast transaction times and low fees, Stellar’s offerings no longer feel unique in today’s Layer 1 space. Without major changes or upgrades, it risks fading from attention. The excitement around Stellar’s rise may weaken unless backed by deeper ecosystem growth. Cold Wallet, on the other hand, doesn’t depend on price spikes. It rewards every transaction through cashback tiers. This utility-first model continues working even during sideways markets. While Stellar stalls, Cold Wallet gives active users a reason to stay engaged and earn with every action. Cold Wallet Turns Daily Crypto Use Into Cashback and 50x Returns Cold Wallet fixes one of crypto’s biggest problems, transaction fees that punish users for staying active. Most platforms take value from the user, especially on swaps, gas fees, or fiat ramps. Cold Wallet reverses that idea. Every action within the app earns $CWT, the utility coin that powers its cashback model. At Stage 16 of presale, it’s priced at $0.00942. The launch value is fixed at $0.3517, creating a return of 3,600% for early supporters. But the appeal isn’t just upside. Cold Wallet gives users a direct way to earn on activity. Holding more $CWT unlocks greater cashback rewards, up to 100%. No staking. No lock-ins. Just use the platform and earn. It includes four loyalty tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond. Top-tier users receive full gas refunds and 50% cashback on swap and ramp fees. This system benefits people who actually use the wallet daily, not just large holders waiting on price moves. More than 682.8 million coins have already been sold, and the project has raised $5.6 million. With referral rewards that give both sides something and cashback that activates without delay, Cold Wallet is building a model centered on value returned to the user. It isn’t a wallet you just store crypto in, it’s one that works for you every day. Cold Wallet Brings Practical Value While Others Wait As XRP’s progress stalls due to delayed ETF news and Stellar’s rally hits resistance, Cold Wallet is quietly building something more sustainable. It rewards users for actual activity, not just holding. With a 3,600% ROI opportunity, cashback on fees, and over 682.8 million coins sold, it’s already proving itself. Cold Wallet doesn’t rely on speculation or external triggers. Its model puts value back in users’ hands, creating daily utility that works across all market conditions.

In a high-level meeting with Vice President Gibran Rakabuming Raka’s office, representatives from Bitcoin Indonesia presented a detailed proposal outlining how the country could use surplus renewable energy to mine and accumulate Bitcoin as part of a long-term economic development plan. Indonesian Bitcoin (BTC) Reserve Move Despite stringent crypto tax policies and a nationwide ban on using crypto for payments, Indonesian officials are reportedly receptive to the idea of a Bitcoin reserve for the economy. A key component of the discussion involved the importance of public education, with Bitcoin Indonesia advocating for awareness programs to improve understanding of Bitcoin’s economic potential. The group also shared macroeconomic projections, including Michael Saylor’s bullish forecast of Bitcoin reaching $13 million by 2045. With a stable inflation rate of 0.76% and a debt-to-GDP ratio of just 39%, Indonesia’s interest in Bitcoin is not driven by economic desperation but rather by a strategic vision to diversify its reserves and leverage untapped geothermal and hydroelectric energy for sustainable mining. Brazil Moves Forward with Crypto Reserve Legislation While Indonesia explores its options, Brazil is already advancing a national conversation on Bitcoin reserves . The country’s House of Representatives is scheduled to hold a public hearing on August 20 to debate a bill that could allow up to 5% of its treasury, approximately $15 billion, to be allocated to Bitcoin. Six key institutions, including Brazil’s central bank and finance ministry, will participate in the discussions. Though the bill faces opposition from some financial authorities, Vice President Geraldo Alckmin’s office has endorsed it as being in the national interest. This marks Brazil’s first-ever public hearing on crypto reserves and underscores a growing global shift toward the institutionalization of Bitcoin. A Global Trend Toward Sovereign Bitcoin Holdings Indonesia and Brazil join a growing list of nations, including the United States, Ukraine, Bhutan, and Kazakhstan, that are actively exploring Bitcoin as a strategic reserve asset.

As of today, ETH trades at approximately $3,598, reflecting a 1% decrease in the past 24 hours. This pullback follows months of mixed price action across the market, as traders balance optimism over long-term fundamentals with short-term risk management. New insights from on-chain data suggest heightened market activity surrounding Ethereum despite its failure to reclaim the $4,000 mark. Analysts point to unprecedented levels of Open Interest (OI) in Ethereum futures contracts, combined with record daily transactions on its network. While this signals growing participation and network adoption, it also raises concerns about potential volatility if market sentiment shifts abruptly. Related Reading: Ethereum Price Falters Above $3,700 – Is a Pullback Brewing? Ethereum Open Interest Hits All-Time High CryptoQuant analyst CryptoOnchain reported that Ethereum’s OI on Binance has recently reached a record-breaking $77 billion. Open Interest measures the total number of outstanding derivative contracts, providing insight into market activity and trader participation. The surge suggests that more capital is entering ETH futures markets, potentially setting the stage for significant price movements. This rise in OI coincides with Ethereum reaching its highest daily transaction count ever recorded. Analysts link this spike in activity to increased engagement in decentralized finance (DeFi), growth in layer-2 scaling solutions, and broader adoption of Ethereum-based applications. CryptoOnchain noted that such developments “highlight growing participation and user engagement,” adding that this type of market buildup often precedes sharp price trends, either upward or downward. However, this accumulation of leveraged positions carries risk. If price movements turn unfavorable for the majority of open contracts, a wave of liquidations could occur, amplifying volatility. This has been a recurring theme in the cryptocurrency market, where leveraged positions can trigger cascading sell-offs during sudden price corrections. Bearish Signals Emerge from Market Order Activity Another CryptoQuant analyst, Maartunn, highlighted a different indicator that reflects short-term market pressure on Ethereum. According to his data, Net Taker Volume for ETH stood at -$418.8 million daily. This figure represents roughly 115,400 more ETH sold via market orders than bought, indicating a clear imbalance in favor of sellers. Market orders, unlike limit orders, execute trades immediately at the best available price. A sustained negative Net Taker Volume often signals urgency among sellers, potentially foreshadowing further downside if buy-side demand fails to absorb the selling pressure. Maartunn explained that “such behavior indicates participants were willing to prioritize execution speed over price,” typically a bearish market sign.

During a podcast appearance this week, Long was openly skeptical of the company behind XRP. She alleged that the company had fallen short of its initial mission, replacing traditional banking, specifically the SWIFT network. Although on top of this, she also claimed that Ripple’s past had “all the makings” of an initial coin offering (ICO) and argued why Ripple would be releasing a new stablecoin on Ethereum rather than entirely through the XRP Ledger. Schwartz quickly took to social media, particularly X, dispelled the misinformation, and offered further engagement. “I’m available whenever you want to chat about the facts about Ripple, our stablecoin RLUSD, the XRP Ledger, and its native token XRP.” He wrote . Schwartz also directed readers to a detailed post by XRPL validator @Vet_X0, which “sets the record straight” and is a useful entry point for anyone seeking factual information. XRPL validator rejects ‘ICO’ allegations The validator, Vet ( @Vet_X0 ), strongly rejected Caitlin Long’s characterization of XRP as the result of an initial coin offering (ICO). He said she appeared to lack a clear understanding of the subject, yet spoke about it confidently. Vet explained that Ripple did not raise funds through an ICO. Instead, when the XRP Ledger launched in 2012, the entire supply of 100 billion XRP tokens was placed in a genesis account. At that time, the tokens had no monetary value and no public sale or capital raise. This counters Long’s claim that XRP’s origins are comparable to projects like Ethereum, which conducted a well-documented public ICO in 2014, raising funds in Bitcoin to distribute ETH to early backers. Vet also had a beef with Long claiming not once, but twice, that Ripple essentially centralizes the XRP Ledger. Vet said Long’s comments were either ignorance or technical illiteracy. He said that XRP Ledger is open-source and decentralized, and that anyone could run a validator or fork the code. Currently, the XRPL hosts over 1,000 nodes and over 100 active validators, many of which are controlled by independent individuals, universities, businesses, and financial institutions, not Ripple. Ripple said it does not own these validators and can’t update the network unaided. Ripple expands RLUSD to both Ethereum and XRPL Caitlin Long is concerned that the choice made by Ripple to launch its RLUSD stablecoin on Ethereum contradicts its original vision of using the XRP Ledger as the backbone of global finance. She suggested switching to Ethereum might mean Ripple isn’t trusting in its infrastructure. XRPL validator Vet replied that RLUSD was to be issued on Ethereum and the XRP Ledger as a deliberate multi-chain strategy. He stressed that this isn’t a move away from XRPL but rather a pragmatic attempt to enhance liquidity and target a more diverse audience across other blockchain ecosystems. According to Vet, Ripple Payments and RLUSD continue to operate natively on the XRP Ledger, and Ethereum’s involvement merely complements—not replaces—the network’s capabilities. Vet also took the opportunity to spotlight XRPL’s long-standing technical leadership. He noted that the XRP Ledger was the first blockchain to embed a decentralized exchange (DEX) directly into its protocol. It also pioneered native tokenization, enabling users to issue custom assets without relying on smart contracts. Development on the XRP Ledger, Vet stressed, has never stagnated. Its amendment system continually adds new features based on community consensus. He described the ecosystem as vibrant, supported by a growing developer base, strong liquidity, and deeper connections to real-world finance, which are further strengthened with the rollout of RLUSD.

Economists and markets widely anticipate a 25 basis point cut , maintaining the central bank’s current once-per-quarter pace of monetary easing. The decision will be announced at 12 p.m. in London, followed by a press conference with Governor Andrew Bailey at 12:30 p.m. The rate cut would mark the fifth consecutive quarter-point reduction, bringing UK rates below those of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which last moved in 2024 and currently holds its benchmark at 4.25%–4.5%. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to stick with its cautious guidance of “gradual and careful” reductions, as inflation pressures re-emerge. June inflation came in at 3.6%, higher than the bank’s 3.4% forecast and its highest reading in 17 months, driven by surging energy and food prices. The BoE may now revise its near-term inflation outlook closer to 4% for the year. Governor Bailey has downplayed the spike as temporary, but Chief Economist Huw Pill and others have warned of second-round effects feeding into wages and core inflation. BoE faces mounting growth risks as job losses soar Meanwhile, growth concerns have intensified following back-to-back contractions in the spring and rising unemployment tied to April’s payroll tax and minimum wage hikes. More than 180,000 jobs have been lost since Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a £26 billion increase in employer national insurance contributions, pushing the unemployment rate to a four-year high. The MPC is expected to highlight these labour market challenges in its updated projections. In May, it forecast growth of 1% in 2025 and 1.25% in 2026, though recent data suggests a potential upward revision after better-than-expected Q1 performance and an upgraded estimate for Q2 growth. The decision is likely to expose divisions within the nine-member MPC. A Bloomberg survey suggests a three-way split: most members favouring a 25bp cut, two pushing for a larger 50bp move, and two likely to vote for no change. Pill and external member Catherine Mann, who opposed cuts in May, are expected to maintain their stance, while Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor may advocate for a more aggressive reduction. While today’s move is mostly priced in, traders will be watching closely for any change in forward guidance. Markets expect one more cut this year, likely in November, bringing the rate down to around 3.5% by 2026. “The risks are tilted in a hawkish direction,” said Dan Hanson, Chief UK Economist at Bloomberg Economics. “The committee may signal it’s rethinking its once-a-quarter pace, implying a November cut isn’t guaranteed.” BoE reconsiders bond sales strategy as long-dated gilt yields surge Attention is also turning to the BoE’s balance sheet reduction strategy. Quantitative tightening (QT) has already reduced bond holdings by about £100 billion annually, but market strain—especially in long-dated gilts—has sparked speculation that the BoE could slow or shift the pace of sales. Governor Bailey has recently flagged concerns over rising 30-year gilt yields, reaching levels last seen in the late 1990s. A pivot toward shorter-dated debt or a reduced pace of active sales (currently expected at £26 billion a year) may be under consideration ahead of the BoE’s September QT update. According to Sanjay Raja, Chief UK Economist at Deutsche Bank, a signal acknowledging long-end liquidity issues could foreshadow changes in the BoE’s sales strategy.

Here's what's making news in the markets: Welcome to Asia Morning Briefing, a daily summary of top stories during U.S. hours and an overview of market moves and analysis. For a detailed overview of U.S. markets, see CoinDesk's Crypto Daybook Americas. Bitcoin (BTC) is treading water around $115K Thursday morning in Asia, up 1% in the last 24 hours, as the post-all-time-high correction continues to play out across low volume and weak conviction. According to Glassnode , BTC has entered what it calls an “air gap”, a low-liquidity zone between $110,000 and $116,000, after breaking down from a major supply cluster where short-term holders had previously found support. These areas typically see little trading activity and can either serve as a base for accumulation or become a trapdoor for deeper downside if demand fails to return. “The market is effectively re-finding its footing,” Glassnode analysts wrote, describing the range between $110K (the prior ATH) and $116K (recent buyer cost basis) as the new battleground. They noted that while opportunistic buying has emerged, with 120,000 BTC acquired on the dip, prices have yet to reclaim resistance levels convincingly, particularly the ~$116.9K threshold that marks recent short-term holder entry points. Short-term holder profitability has dropped from 100% to 70%, which Glassnode frames as typical for a bull market mid-phase. But without fresh inflows, this could quickly erode sentiment. ETF flows have turned negative, with a -1.5K BTC outflow earlier this week, the largest since April. At the same time, funding rates in the derivatives market have cooled, reflecting reduced leverage and a more cautious stance among speculators. Market maker Enflux offered a similar take: “Crypto markets remain in a fragile holding pattern. Despite some relief in the altcoin space, majors like BTC and ETH are still struggling to inspire confidence,” it wrote in a client note. “The broader trend? Heavy legs with more or less light volume.” ETH is up 2% in the last 24 hours, trading just below $3,600. The CoinDesk 20 Index , which tracks a broad basket of crypto assets, gained 1.69% to 3,815.22. “Until BTC and ETH reclaim strength with volume,” Enflux added, “the path of least resistance could remain sideways to down.” The market’s next move likely hinges on whether buyers are willing to step in and build a base within this low-volume zone, or whether another flush toward $110K is needed to reset the trend. For now, traders remain cautious, and the bulls remain unproven. Market Movers: BTC: A potential Bitcoin supply shock, driven by drying OTC desk reserves and steady corporate accumulation, could “uncork” BTC price action after a dip below $110K, market observers say. ETH: Ethereum may have formed a local top as sell pressure hits $419 million, its second-highest on record, while ETH retests a major resistance zone near $4,000 that preceded a 66% drop in late 2024, raising the risk of a 25–35% decline by September; meanwhile, Polymarket bettors remain split, with 48% backing a rally to $5,000 despite the bearish signals. Gold: Gold's rally stalled Wednesday as traders took profits and weighed rising Fed rate cut odds, U.S. trade tensions, and a looming Fed leadership shakeup, leaving prices flat after a three-day gain driven by economic weakness; spot gold last traded at $3,372.11, down 0.24% on the day.

The launch of its second-generation smartphone has captured the attention of both crypto investors and mobile tech enthusiasts. Meanwhile, early investors looking for the next big opportunity are also watching MAGACOIN FINANCE, a project gaining serious traction during its early stage with massive upside projections. Seeker Smartphone: A Web3 Powerhouse in Your Pocket Solana Mobile has begun shipping its new crypto-focused smartphone, the Seeker, to over 50 countries worldwide. With more than 150,000 units pre-ordered, it’s already outpacing the original Saga phone, which sold just 20,000. Retailing at $450–$500, the Seeker is expected to bring in at least $67.5 million in revenue. But what truly sets the Seeker apart is its deep integration with blockchain tools. It includes a hardware-isolated Seed Vault for securely storing private keys and recovery phrases, along with a decentralized app store that bypasses Apple and Google’s restrictive frameworks. This opens up direct access to NFTs, DeFi, games, and dApps—all without the usual 30% commissions or app store bans. New Contender Could Outperform Even Solana’s Gains While Solana is generating buzz with real-world products, MAGACOIN FINANCE is turning heads with numbers. With analysts forecasting up to 14,500% returns from its current stage, it’s quickly becoming one of the most talked-about altcoins of the year . As access tightens and allocations vanish, MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing comparisons to early-stage SHIB and DOGE—but with a more advanced ecosystem in development. For those entering before major exchange listings, the potential could be enormous. Is $500 SOL a Realistic Target? The buzz around the Seeker has added fresh fuel to Solana’s price outlook . Already showing strength amid altcoin rotation, SOL could ride the wave of mobile adoption to new highs. Analysts point to key ecosystem metrics—DeFi TVL, NFT activity, and user growth—as signs of continued strength. If momentum holds, a run to $500 is within reach, especially considering the anticipation of spot ETF approval. Conclusion The Seeker’s launch marks a major step forward for crypto-native mobile tech, and Solana is leading the charge.

Priced at $0.035, the new DeFi project has caught the eye of traders. investors who get in on phase 6 presale of MUTM will experience a 71.43% return on investment as the project goes live at $0.06. Mutuum Finance has now surpassed over $14.1 million and over 14,800 investors. Meanwhile, legacy tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) continue to struggle with sideways momentum and lack of innovation, making way for utility-driven platforms like Mutuum to dominate headlines and investor interest. As capital rotates into more purpose-built DeFi ecosystems, the narrative this month belongs not to memecoins but to the rise of next-gen, use-case-backed assets like MUTM. Dogecoin (DOGE) Hovering Near $0.20 Amid Rotation Toward Utility-Driven Tokens Dogecoin is currently trading around $0.20, having pulled back roughly 4% in the past 24 hours and about 15% off its July peak of around $0.26–$0.27 as investor appetite shifts away from meme narratives. Despite whale accumulation, over 2 billion DOGE (~$400M) observed at $0.21 support levels, technical indicators like weakening RSI and flat volume suggest momentum is waning. Short-term resistance sits in the $0.23–$0.24 zone, while support levels around $0.20–$0.21 could determine DOGE’s next path. As capital begins rotating toward utility-driven DeFi platforms, emerging protocol narratives like Mutuum Finance are increasingly drawing investor focus. Mutuum Finance Launches Phase 6 of Token Presale Mutuum Finance has recently introduced Round 6 of its presale with tokens now live at $0.035, a 16.17% increase from the last round. The next price increase will take the token up by another 14.29% to $0.04, so members will now be able to make 71.43% when it finally goes live at $0.06. The presale itself has already garnered over 14,800 investors and raised over $14.1 million, demonstrating the belief that the market has placed on the potential of MUTM. Dual-Lending: Empowering Future-Proof DeFi Mutuum Finance adopts a twin-model approach of facilitating flexibility and efficacy in Peer-to-Contract and Peer-to-Peer lending models. Peer-to-Contract makes use of autonomous smart contracts that carry out the lending independently without any participation of human beings whatsoever. They have been designed to operate on dynamic rates in the market with an unpredictable rate of interest as guided by existing demand and supply of an in-real-time interest. Peer-to-Peer model reduces intermediaries and allows market to be in direct interaction with borrowers and lenders. Mutuum Finance Boosts Stability Focus Mutuum Finance (MUTM) will introduce a stablecoin to be USD-pegged on the Ethereum blockchain. It will be sound and secure investment product to remove risk and uncertainty that can be attributed to algorithmic stablecoins. The project is audited with a 95.0 trust score by Certik. That is a key milestone as much as Mutuum Finance’s goal is to become an institutional-grade and transparent DeFi protocol. That also shows that the team is proud to be industry security standards-compliant. Mutuum Finance Deploys $50K Bug Bounty to Strengthen Protocol Security Mutuum Finance has initiated its Bug Bounty Program with the reward pool value of $50,000 USDT. There are four severity levels in the program. They include critical, major, minor, and low. All the probable bugs are hence found and rewarded. It is in line with the vision of the team to establish a secure, open, and quality DeFi protocol. As Dogecoin stalls near $0.20 with little to show in terms of innovation, Mutuum Finance (MUTM) is gaining momentum fast. The project has already raised over $14.1 million and attracted 14,800+ investors, signaling strong market confidence. Investors joining Phase 6 at $0.035 can lock in a 71.43% return when the token launches at $0.06. With a dual-lending system, USD-pegged stablecoin in development, CertiK audit, and $50K bug bounty, MUTM is proving it’s more than hype, it’s built for long-term growth.

That’s why traders are zooming in on four high-upside contenders. This roundup highlights the top altcoin to watch right now, BlockDAG, Hyperliquid, Sui, and Binance Coin (BNB), each showing unique strength, big momentum, and solid structures behind the price action. BlockDAG is exploding with its $364M presale and tech-first ecosystem. Hyperliquid is proving structure matters, even at a premium. Sui thrives on volatility with a technical edge. And BNB? It’s holding strong with real-world adoption and institutional eyes watching. Whether you’re in it for quick flips or long-term gains, these four deserve a closer look. 1. BlockDAG: The Presale Powerhouse Turning Heads in Every Cycle When it comes to presales, few are making waves like BlockDAG (BDAG) . This project blends DAG architecture with Layer 1 scalability, setting it up to handle high volumes without the lag of older blockchains. That’s exactly why traders are flocking in, and why BlockDAG is the top altcoin to watch this season. The numbers are loud: $364 million raised, 24.8 billion BDAG coins sold, over 18,900 miners gone, and $7.7 million in hardware revenue. BDAG is priced at $0.0016 right now, while its listing is locked at $0.05. That’s a staggering 3,025% return sitting in plain sight. The 10 BTC Auction adds more fuel, every buyer gets a shot at winning Bitcoin. With this bonus and the price window closing by August 11, the energy around BDAG is real. Traders know it: this is one of the biggest shots to get in before liftoff. 2. Sui: Volatility-Driven & Timing-Obsessed Sui lives for volatility, and traders love it. Built with the Move programming language, it’s designed to give more control over digital ownership and speed. That draws in users who want performance without compromise. SUI reacts fast to market shifts, making it a prime target for tactical trades. Right now, it’s hovering at levels traders are eyeing for potential reentry. For anyone scanning for the top altcoin to watch during uncertain conditions, Sui delivers precision opportunities. It’s less about hype, more about execution, and the payoff can be real if the entry is right. 3. Hyperliquid: High Price, Strong Structure, Still on Radar Hyperliquid isn’t cheap, but it’s not backing down either. While many sit on the sidelines hoping for a dip, HYPE continues to show it’s built on solid foundations. The buzz comes from its role in the perpetual futures space, where speed, depth, and on-chain data are driving next-level platforms. Its infrastructure meets the needs of fast-moving markets while staying decentralized. For those waiting on bullish sentiment to return, Hyperliquid is the one to stalk. The price may not be perfect yet, but the structure is strong, and when it moves, it could move big. 4. BNB: Real Utility Meets Long-Term Power BNB is one of the few tokens that doesn’t just rely on speculation. As the fuel behind Binance Smart Chain, it powers trading, staking, and governance, putting it at the center of daily crypto activity. Despite market dips, BNB is holding near all-time highs. That kind of stability is turning heads at the institutional level. Talks of BNB-backed products, crypto funds, and new treasuries show just how deep the value runs. For traders playing the long game, BNB isn’t just an exchange token, it’s a foundation for serious growth. BDAG Takes the Lead in This Altcoin Race Each of these picks has something to offer, from Sui’s sharp moves to BNB’s consistent traction. Hyperliquid shows us why structure matters, even at high prices. But one project is hitting on all fronts: BlockDAG. Presale strength? Check. $364 million locked in. Real tools? Already live. Community momentum? Surging. BlockDAG isn’t waiting to prove itself, it’s doing it right now. For those aiming for big upside, solid tech, and a clear launch plan, this is the top altcoin to watch before the next phase begins. If you’re serious about catching the next breakout, don’t let this one pass you by.

Cold Wallet is the clear exception. It recently finalized a $270 million purchase, securing active infrastructure and a user base of more than 2 million, all before its official launch. This isn’t just a pitch on paper. Cold Wallet (CWT) is already functioning with tested systems and a built-in real-time cashback mechanism. It’s not preparing to look legitimate later. It’s already doing what others promise. In a market filled with vague blueprints, Cold Wallet stands out as one of the rare 2025 crypto presales showing actual results. A Bold $270M Acquisition That Changes the Game Where most presale projects are still seeking attention and building from the ground up, Cold Wallet made a strategic move with a $270 million acquisition. This deal brought the well-established Plus Wallet under its ownership, along with over 2 million active users. It wasn’t a marketing gimmick or token trade; it was a real purchase that redefined Cold Wallet’s standing. It’s not a small concept hoping to grow, it’s already equipped with the tools, tech, and user traction. For anyone reviewing crypto presales 2025, Cold Wallet isn’t forecasting what it might become; it’s building it already. Two Million Users Integrated Instantly With the Plus Wallet takeover, Cold Wallet didn’t just obtain software. It gained people. Over 2 million functioning wallets are now part of its system, with no long onboarding or transition delays. This scale of verified user migration is nearly unmatched among presales. While others rely on giveaways and referral campaigns, Cold Wallet now launches with one of the strongest user bases in the space. Each of these users adds power to the Cold Wallet ecosystem’s usage, demand, and pace. CWT isn’t merely a presale token; it powers an ecosystem that’s already running. Built on Working Systems, Not Empty Promises Cold Wallet also inherited a full-fledged operational backend and user interface through the acquisition. This matters. It allows Cold Wallet to release features quickly and without delays or broken promises. Core functions like wallet setup, gas tracking, fiat on-ramps, and multi-chain swaps aren’t goals; they’re already active features, thanks to the structure taken from Plus Wallet. Macro view of a screen of trading terminal with abstract financial graph and digits. Trading and forex concept. 3D Rendering Instead of starting at zero, Cold Wallet is accelerating a platform that already functions efficiently. Real Cashback That Rewards Activity Cold Wallet’s reward system isn’t an add-on. It’s central to the product. Users earn automatic cashback in CWT for performing tasks like swapping, transferring, or paying for gas. There are no complicated steps, staking requirements, or interfaces to navigate. The more CWT held, the higher the cashback tier, ranging from 10% up to 100%. This model directly connects platform usage to token demand. With millions of users arriving, that structure becomes even more valuable. Referral Program With Immediate Payouts Cold Wallet’s referral structure is designed to reward users upfront. Referrers earn USDT immediately, along with bonus CWT coins during the ongoing presale phase. There’s no post-launch delay or empty promises. It’s real-time value shared with those helping grow the network. This transforms Cold Wallet into a network-growing tool. Each referral not only boosts numbers but also enhances token circulation and reach. Cold Wallet’s Presale Numbers Surge Cold Wallet’s presale is still early, yet the progress is massive. The price in Stage 16 is set at $0.00942, while the listing price is projected at $0.3517. This indicates a gain potential of over 4,900%. So far, over 685 million CWT have been sold and the presale has brought in more than $5.7 million. This isn’t a case of searching for traction. Cold Wallet already has momentum and still offers entry at favorable terms. Why Cold Wallet Leads Among Crypto Presales 2025 Rather than making claims about future developments, Cold Wallet has already achieved key milestones. From securing a $270M platform and integrating 2 million users, to activating live systems and distributing real cashback, everything is already in motion. The referral rewards are live. The wallet features are deployed. The tech works and scales. There are no missing parts, only continued progress. Among all crypto presales 2025 , few are showing this level of readiness. Cold Wallet stands apart with real infrastructure, a solid user base, and a clear model linking utility to value. And with early presale stages still active, the entry point remains attractive for those following tangible success.

A Bold $270M Acquisition That Changes the Game Where most presale projects are still seeking attention and building from the ground up, Cold Wallet made a strategic move with a $270 million acquisition. This deal brought the well-established Plus Wallet under its ownership, along with over 2 million active users. It wasn’t a marketing gimmick or token trade; it was a real purchase that redefined Cold Wallet’s standing. It’s not a small concept hoping to grow, it’s already equipped with the tools, tech, and user traction. For anyone reviewing crypto presales 2025, Cold Wallet isn’t forecasting what it might become; it’s building it already. Two Million Users Integrated Instantly With the Plus Wallet takeover, Cold Wallet didn’t just obtain software. It gained people. Over 2 million functioning wallets are now part of its system, with no long onboarding or transition delays. This scale of verified user migration is nearly unmatched among presales. While others rely on giveaways and referral campaigns, Cold Wallet now launches with one of the strongest user bases in the space. Each of these users adds power to the Cold Wallet ecosystem’s usage, demand, and pace. CWT isn’t merely a presale token; it powers an ecosystem that’s already running. Built on Working Systems, Not Empty Promises Cold Wallet also inherited a full-fledged operational backend and user interface through the acquisition. This matters. It allows Cold Wallet to release features quickly and without delays or broken promises. Core functions like wallet setup, gas tracking, fiat on-ramps, and multi-chain swaps aren’t goals; they’re already active features, thanks to the structure taken from Plus Wallet. Macro view of a screen of trading terminal with abstract financial graph and digits. Trading and forex concept. 3D Rendering Instead of starting at zero, Cold Wallet is accelerating a platform that already functions efficiently. Real Cashback That Rewards Activity Cold Wallet’s reward system isn’t an add-on. It’s central to the product. Users earn automatic cashback in CWT for performing tasks like swapping, transferring, or paying for gas. There are no complicated steps, staking requirements, or interfaces to navigate. The more CWT held, the higher the cashback tier, ranging from 10% up to 100%. This model directly connects platform usage to token demand. With millions of users arriving, that structure becomes even more valuable. Referral Program With Immediate Payouts Cold Wallet’s referral structure is designed to reward users upfront. Referrers earn USDT immediately, along with bonus CWT coins during the ongoing presale phase. There’s no post-launch delay or empty promises. It’s real-time value shared with those helping grow the network. This transforms Cold Wallet into a network-growing tool. Each referral not only boosts numbers but also enhances token circulation and reach. Cold Wallet’s Presale Numbers Surge Cold Wallet’s presale is still early, yet the progress is massive. The price in Stage 16 is set at $0.00942, while the listing price is projected at $0.3517. This indicates a gain potential of over 4,900%. So far, over 685 million CWT have been sold and the presale has brought in more than $5.7 million. This isn’t a case of searching for traction. Cold Wallet already has momentum and still offers entry at favorable terms. Why Cold Wallet Leads Among Crypto Presales 2025 Rather than making claims about future developments, Cold Wallet has already achieved key milestones. From securing a $270M platform and integrating 2 million users, to activating live systems and distributing real cashback, everything is already in motion. The referral rewards are live. The wallet features are deployed. The tech works and scales. There are no missing parts, only continued progress. Among all crypto presales 2025 , few are showing this level of readiness. Cold Wallet stands apart with real infrastructure, a solid user base, and a clear model linking utility to value. And with early presale stages still active, the entry point remains attractive for those following tangible success.

Three names are making the loudest noise, Spartans.com, Stake.com, and Betway. Each follows a different plan. Stake builds buzz with ongoing prize pools, Betway offers steady seasonal free bet deals, and Spartans turns all the spotlight on a single grand prize, a Lamborghini, for one winner. For those chasing life-changing wins, the question is not only who offers the biggest prize, but also who offers the clearest way to get it. Here’s how these three heavyweights compare when ambition, clarity, and player experience go head-to-head. Spartans: Single-Prize Lamborghini Giveaway Grabs Big Attention Spartans has focused all its promotional effort on one major goal, awarding a Lamborghini to a single winner in a live-streamed finale. Unlike quiet prize draws or rotating offers, Spartans makes the entire process public and competitive. Entry is simple: sign up, deposit crypto, and opt into the Lamborghini Challenge. There are no complex missions or unclear rules. This direct style makes Spartans stand out in 2025’s big prize scene as one of the most confident operators. The pull is powerful. One grand prize creates more excitement than many smaller, hidden rewards. Every deposit feels like a step toward the spotlight. Both casual players and high-stakes users instantly understand the stakes and can’t ignore the outcome. In 2025, this is a clear example of a crypto giveaway designed to thrill rather than just keep people engaged. With instant withdrawals after the win, Spartans also sets a higher standard for trust and transparency, giving the campaign both credibility and maximum player impact. Stake.com: Constant Prizes Over One Big Spotlight Stake.com builds its giveaways around non-stop action. Players see weekly $50,000 raffles, leaderboard races, and rotating prize pools. The aim is simple, keep the activity flowing with plenty of chances to win. It’s a perfect fit for regular players who enjoy tracking many promos. Stake also fuels engagement through community live streams and influencer tie-ins. Still, while the total prize value is huge, the focus gets blurred. Rewards are shared among thousands or replaced so quickly that no single event stands out. For some, this means more chances. For others, it means less thrill. Against Spartans’ single Lamborghini spotlight, Stake’s rewards lean more on loyalty than emotion. Strong in numbers, but lighter in lasting impact. Betway: Steady and Safe Rewards Betway takes a more traditional route, seasonal giveaways, boosted odds, and free bet draws. While not fully crypto-focused, some areas now allow digital currency play. Joining is easy: place a bet, earn an entry, and you could win credits, merchandise, or small cash amounts. This works for players who want stability over spectacle. But in a year when crypto gambling promos are getting bolder and more public, Betway’s approach feels careful. The prizes rarely hit the size that sparks major excitement, and the process blends in with the sportsbook’s regular flow. For those wanting easy bonuses, it’s fine. But compared to a Lamborghini or weekly six-figure pools, Betway’s style comes across as safe, but forgettable. Wrap Up The key difference in this contest is intent. Spartans is built to be remembered. The Lamborghini Challenge rewards and impresses in equal measure. It’s public, final, and impossible to mix up with a normal promo. Stake spreads its big rewards across too many winners to create one unforgettable moment. Betway stays in its comfort zone instead of pushing limits. Spartans wins not just on the size of the prize but on how it’s delivered, clear entry, tangible reward, and a finale set for all to see. This rare mix of openness and excitement makes it stand out among big prize sites. For players choosing where to play, Spartans tells the simplest story: no missions, no point systems, no tiers. Just one question, do you want the car? And for many, that clarity beats the noise of endless promos.

The outage occurred on August 5, 2025, and was caused by unexpected on-chain congestion combined with an unprepared backup sequencer. While Base is designed with high availability in mind—featuring multiple sequencer instances managed by Conductor (an OP Stack component)—a critical handoff failure required manual intervention to resume operations. This event sparked immediate fear and speculation across the crypto community. Investors and users began to question the sustainability of the network, especially as Layer-2 scaling solutions are expected to offer seamless, reliable performance. The incident highlighted potential vulnerabilities in the sequencer infrastructure, casting doubt on whether Base can maintain uptime and stability during periods of high demand. As trust in the network was momentarily shaken, critics pointed to the risks of centralized sequencer management, while supporters emphasized that the quick response prevented a longer disruption. Nonetheless, the reputational impact has raised concerns for both institutional users and DeFi projects considering the network for deployment. The coming weeks will be critical as they address these concerns and work to restore confidence in the network. Base Outlines Root Cause And Fixes Network Outage Following the recent 33-minute network disruption, Base published a detailed postmortem report explaining the technical root cause and the mitigation steps taken to restore the network. The issue stemmed from a sequencer handoff failure within the system’s High Availability (HA) cluster, which is managed by Conductor, an OP Stack component designed to maintain uptime and minimize single points of failure. At 6:07am UTC, the active sequencer started lagging behind due to intense on-chain activity. Conductor, functioning as intended, initiated an automated handoff to a new sequencer. However, the new sequencer was still being provisioned and wasn’t yet ready to produce blocks. Typically, if a newly elected sequencer is unhealthy, Conductor would perform another handoff. Unfortunately, since Conductor wasn’t fully operational on this sequencer, it couldn’t initiate another transfer. By 6:09am UTC, monitoring systems flagged the issue, and the Base team was paged. At 6:12am UTC, the incident was officially declared. To mitigate the issue, Base engineers paused Conductor’s HA software to stop further faulty leadership transfers and manually elected a healthy sequencer. By 6:40am UTC, the network had resumed normal operations. To prevent future incidents, Base is working on updating its infrastructure to ensure that any sequencer added to the cluster is always capable of leadership transfer if elected. Additionally, the team is enhancing testing protocols to validate these fixes before deployment. These measures are aimed at bolstering Base’s system robustness and avoiding similar disruptions in the future. Ethereum Price Action Reflects Market Caution Ethereum (ETH) is currently trading at $3,611.52 after experiencing a sharp decline from its recent local high of $3,940. The price is struggling to regain bullish momentum, failing to hold above the $3,700 resistance zone. This chart shows that ETH has entered a consolidation phase after its aggressive rally from $2,852.16, which remains a key support level in case of further downside. The 50-day moving average (blue line) is acting as dynamic resistance around the $3,640 zone, while the 100-day (green line) and 200-day (red line) moving averages are still positioned below the price, reflecting a broader bullish trend. However, the recent rejection near the $3,860.80 level indicates that bulls are losing control in the short term. While Base itself doesn’t have a native token, its performance is closely tied to Ethereum’s Layer-2 ecosystem narrative. Investors are now watching closely to see if ETH can stabilize above $3,600, as any further weakness could amplify doubts about the broader L2 market.

Market data from CoinGecko shows the total crypto market capitalization currently stands at approximately $3.79 trillion, representing a 0.4% decline in the last 24 hours. This pullback follows a period of uncertainty across major digital assets, with both Bitcoin and altcoins facing limited buying momentum despite periods of volatility. Analysts suggest that reduced market activity and fluctuations in leveraged trading positions are playing a significant role in current market behavior. Insights from Binance, one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges globally, highlight shifting trader sentiment as leverage levels decline while overall price movement remains subdued. These changes raise questions about whether the market is entering a phase of consolidation or setting up for more volatility ahead. Related Reading: Bitcoin Inflows To Binance Accelerate: Investor Behavior Shifts After Months Of Decline Leverage Trends on Binance Point to Market Reset According to a recent analysis from CryptoQuant contributor Arab Chain, leverage usage on Binance has decreased notably in recent days. The analyst explains that falling leverage is typically a short-term positive indicator as it suggests the exit of overleveraged traders and a reduction in forced liquidations. This can help stabilize price fluctuations and reduce abrupt sell-offs that often trigger sharp market corrections. However, Arab Chain points out that the current scenario differs slightly. Both price levels and leverage ratios have declined simultaneously, indicating that spot market buying has not picked up to offset selling activity. “The lack of strong demand in the spot market weakens the probability of a rapid recovery,” the analyst wrote. This trend highlights a more cautious approach from traders, potentially reflecting macroeconomic uncertainties or a wait-and-see attitude ahead of key market developments. The estimated leverage ratio on Binance is considered a critical indicator for short-term sentiment. A high leverage ratio suggests speculative positions are dominating the market, making it more vulnerable to sudden price swings. Conversely, a falling ratio can indicate risk management among traders or widespread liquidations, both of which can temporarily ease volatility. Arab Chain emphasizes that this metric acts as an “early radar” for potential shifts in market momentum. Altcoin Deposits Signal Increased Trading Activity In a separate analysis, CryptoQuant’s Maartunn observed a significant increase in altcoin deposits to Binance, with a seven-day transaction count exceeding 45,000, the highest level since late 2024. This surge in activity coincided with Bitcoin’s recent push above $112,000, suggesting traders are preparing to adjust their positions across a wider range of digital assets. Deposits to exchanges are often interpreted as a signal of upcoming trading activity, as funds are moved from wallets to platforms where they can be quickly exchanged. Whether this results in increased buying or selling depends on how the broader market evolves in the coming days. The uptick in deposits could indicate growing interest in altcoins as traders look for opportunities beyond Bitcoin amid its recent stagnation.

The cryptocurrency world is always in motion, and understanding its shifts is key to navigating its often-volatile waters. Recently, a significant indicator, the Altcoin Season Index , has captured the attention of many. This crucial metric, tracked by CoinMarketCap (CMC), recently registered a value of 36. This figure, down from previous days, signals a clear shift: the crypto market is currently experiencing what is known as Bitcoin Season . What Does the Altcoin Season Index Really Tell Us? The Altcoin Season Index is more than just a number; it is a snapshot of the broader cryptocurrency landscape. It helps investors understand whether altcoins (any cryptocurrency other than Bitcoin) are outperforming Bitcoin or vice versa. This index, which carefully excludes stablecoins and wrapped tokens, compares the 90-day performance of the top 100 coins listed on CMC against Bitcoin. An index score ranging from 1 to 100. Altcoin Season : Occurs when at least 75% of the top 100 altcoins outperform Bitcoin over the past 90 days. Bitcoin Season : Indicated when 25% or fewer of these altcoins manage to outperform Bitcoin. With the index now at 36, it strongly suggests that Bitcoin has been the dominant performer, leading the current market trends . Why Are We Seeing Bitcoin Season Now? The shift to Bitcoin Season is a natural part of the cryptocurrency cycle. Bitcoin often acts as a bellwether for the entire crypto market . When uncertainty rises or institutional interest focuses on established assets, capital tends to flow back into Bitcoin. This strengthens its position relative to altcoins. Several factors can contribute to this phenomenon: Market Stability Seeking : Investors often view Bitcoin as a safer haven during periods of high volatility or macroeconomic concerns. Dominance Cycle : Bitcoin’s price movements frequently dictate the overall direction of the market, influencing altcoin performance . Liquidity Concentration : Larger capital inflows often target Bitcoin first due to its superior liquidity and market capitalization. This dynamic often means that even if altcoins are seeing some gains, Bitcoin’s gains are comparatively larger, leading to a lower Altcoin Season Index . Navigating the Current Crypto Market: What Does This Mean for Your Portfolio? Understanding that we are in Bitcoin Season can help investors adjust their strategies. It is not necessarily a negative signal, but rather an indication of where current capital flows are concentrated. For many, this period might present different opportunities and challenges. Consider these actionable insights: Focus on Bitcoin : If your portfolio is heavily diversified into altcoins, this might be a time to re-evaluate your Bitcoin exposure. Strategic Altcoin Positioning : For those holding altcoins, research projects with strong fundamentals that might weather the Bitcoin Season better or be poised for future growth when the cycle shifts. Risk Management : Periods of Bitcoin dominance can sometimes precede broader market corrections for altcoins, making risk management even more crucial. Monitoring the Altcoin Season Index allows you to make informed decisions based on prevailing market trends . Looking Ahead: Will Altcoin Performance Rebound? The cryptocurrency market is cyclical, and periods of Bitcoin Season eventually give way to Altcoin Season , and vice-versa. While the current Altcoin Season Index suggests Bitcoin’s dominance, this does not mean altcoins are irrelevant. Historically, altcoins have shown incredible resilience and potential for significant gains once market sentiment shifts or specific narratives emerge. Factors that could signal a return to strong altcoin performance include: Sustained Bitcoin price stability or consolidation. Breakthroughs in specific altcoin projects or ecosystems (e.g., Layer 2 solutions, DeFi innovations). Increased retail investor interest spreading beyond Bitcoin. Keeping an eye on these broader market trends and technological advancements within the altcoin space is essential for long-term success. In conclusion, the Altcoin Season Index at 36 clearly indicates that the crypto market is currently in Bitcoin Season . This phase highlights Bitcoin’s current strength and influences altcoin performance . While it calls for a strategic approach to your portfolio, remember that market cycles are dynamic. Staying informed about these crucial market trends and understanding what drives them will empower you to make more confident decisions in the ever-evolving world of digital assets.

Meme coins like Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and PEPE are once again in focus—but investors are starting to reassess where the real upside lies. In the midst of this shift, MAGACOIN FINANCE has caught the attention of high-level crypto traders, with some whales positioning early for what they believe could be a major 31x breakout. Meme Coins Are Back – but for How Long? Shiba Inu (SHIB) is trading around $0.00001220, while PEPE sits slightly lower at $0.00001046. Despite strong communities, both are struggling to regain momentum seen during previous bull runs. Dogecoin (DOGE), the original meme coin, is holding near $0.2044 but has shown signs of slowing down after a recent rally sparked by broader crypto gains. Many investors are now looking for fresh momentum plays—projects that combine meme culture with real tokenomics, scalability, and long-term development. That’s where emerging altcoins are stepping into the spotlight. Why This Hidden Gem Is Drawing Whale Interest With capital flowing out of stagnant meme coins, MAGACOIN FINANCE is becoming the go-to pick for investors looking ahead. Unlike projects stuck in hype cycles, MAGACOIN FINANCE is building an ecosystem that rewards early holders, offers deflationary mechanics, and has a clear roadmap backed by strong community engagement. Analysts are watching closely as whales enter during this early window, forecasting potentia l gains of 31x or more as retail demand begins to build. $500 invested now could realistically turn into $15,500 , according to current price projections—assuming similar momentum to other early-stage altcoin breakouts. What Comes Next for SHIB, PEPE, and DOGE? Shiba Inu’s ecosystem developments—including Shibarium—haven’t yet moved the price significantly. PEPE remains highly volatile and speculative, with limited upside unless volume spikes drastically. Meanwhile, DOGE benefits from its name recognition, but many believe its days of 100x moves are behind it. That’s why investors are rotating into new territory, seeking smaller caps with bigger upside potential. Conclusion Altcoin season is in full swing, but the rules have changed. Traders aren’t just chasing hype—they’re looking for what’s next. While SHIB, PEPE, and DOGE still hold nostalgia value, projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE are commanding attention for their growth potential and strategic entry points.

Despite past rallies, retail sell-offs, weak technicals, and heavy whale dominance are holding DOGE back. Meanwhile, a new viral altcoin is rewriting the script, soaring 400% in just days. As investors chase real innovation and growth, Dogecoin may struggle to keep up in this new market cycle. Dogecoin Slides Again As Whales Keep Buying And Retail Keeps Selling Dogecoin is once again losing steam, dropping over 4% after last week’s brief 37% rally. The excitement that pushed DOGE higher has faded fast, and retail sentiment remains firmly on the sidelines. While whales continue to accumulate, with over 122 billion DOGE now in their hands, smaller holders are still offloading. Retail selling has persisted since early July, and new participants haven’t replaced the exit. This imbalance is weighing heavily on the price. Market data from Coinglass confirms the trend: trading volume is down nearly 47%, and open interest has dropped to $4.85 billion. Technicals paint a grim picture, too. DOGE trades below all major moving averages, including the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day, each reinforcing downward pressure. The MACD is deep in the red, and any small rally attempts are quickly overwhelmed by larger selloffs. Despite heavy whale support, DOGE continues to struggle with strong resistance levels and a lack of new retail enthusiasm. Analysts now question whether Dogecoin can ever realistically approach $1. It’s not just about memes anymore; market structure and momentum say otherwise. Without fresh retail demand and under consistent resistance, DOGE’s path to $1 is becoming harder to imagine. Meanwhile, a new altcoin is stealing the spotlight with a 400% surge, raising fresh questions about where retail energy is heading next. DeSoc Could Be The Viral Altcoin That DOGE Never Became While Dogecoin struggles to find upward momentum, a new altcoin is quietly building massive traction. DeSoc (SOCS) is capturing attention with its decentralized approach to social media, something traditional platforms have failed to deliver. A 2023 study found that 64% of Americans believe social media companies control the news too much. DeSoc takes this seriously, using blockchain to return control to users and protect their data. It’s not about memes or hype; it’s about transparency, fairness, and real utility. The team behind DeSoc has locked their tokens for two years and secured a 30-year liquidity lock, moves that signal a serious long-term vision and market stability. Unlike projects that focus solely on price action, DeSoc backs its mission with multiple security audits, with one already completed and more scheduled. This shows clear dedication to protecting investors and users alike. Its user-friendly design features customizable profiles, integrated wallets, and AI-powered content recommendations, all while safeguarding privacy. However, unlike Dogecoin, which has no real utility, DeSoc has a real-life use case. It is a platform where user ownership, the safety of data, and free speech are the primary concerns. With token distribution fully transparent and early access already generating buzz, DeSoc is shaping up to be the altcoin that doesn’t just ride a wave it builds one.

This significant eight-point jump from the previous day indicates a notable shift in investor sentiment across the cryptocurrency landscape, moving from ‘Neutral’ into the ‘Greed’ zone. What does this heightened sense of optimism mean for your digital asset holdings? What is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index and Why Does it Matter? The Crypto Fear & Greed Index, provided by the software development platform Alternative, serves as a thermometer for the cryptocurrency market’s emotional state. It ranges from 0 to 100, where 0 signifies extreme fear and 100 indicates extreme greed. This index helps investors understand whether the market is overly fearful (a potential buying opportunity) or overly greedy (a potential correction risk). Understanding this index is vital. When the index shows high market greed , it often suggests that prices might be overextended. Conversely, extreme fear can signal a bottoming out. This tool provides a unique perspective on the collective psyche of crypto participants. Decoding the Shift: From Neutral to Market Greed As of August 7, the index stands at 62, firmly placing the market in the ‘Greed’ category. This rise from the ‘Neutral’ zone suggests that optimism is growing, and more participants are feeling bullish about crypto assets. This shift can be a double-edged sword for investors. While increased optimism can fuel further price appreciation, it also carries risks. High levels of market greed often precede market corrections as investors become less cautious. It is essential to remember that sentiment can change quickly, influencing price volatility. How is the Crypto Fear & Greed Index Calculated? The index considers six different factors to arrive at its score, providing a comprehensive view of crypto market sentiment : Volatility (25%): Measures current volatility and maximum drawdowns of Bitcoin. Market Momentum/Volume (25%): Compares current volume and market momentum with average values. Social Media (15%): Analyzes keywords on various social media platforms. Surveys (15%): Polls investors to gauge their sentiment (currently paused). Bitcoin Dominance (10%): Assesses Bitcoin’s share of the total crypto market cap. Google Trends (10%): Looks at search queries related to Bitcoin. These components collectively paint a picture of prevailing investor sentiment , helping to identify potential market tops or bottoms based on emotional extremes. Understanding Bitcoin Dominance and Its Role Bitcoin dominance is a key factor in the index. It measures Bitcoin’s market capitalization relative to the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. A rising Bitcoin dominance can indicate that investors are moving towards the perceived safety of Bitcoin, potentially pulling liquidity from altcoins. Conversely, falling dominance might suggest an ‘altcoin season’ where capital flows into other digital assets. The index uses this metric because Bitcoin often leads the market. Its dominance can signal broader trends and shifts in crypto market sentiment , affecting the overall fear or greed levels across the entire ecosystem. Navigating the Greed Zone: Actionable Insights for Investors When the Crypto Fear & Greed Index shows significant market greed , what should investors consider? This is a time for careful planning rather than impulsive decisions. While the rising sentiment can be exciting, seasoned investors often use periods of extreme greed as a signal to exercise caution. Here are some actionable insights: Review Your Portfolio: Consider rebalancing or taking some profits, especially from highly appreciated assets. Avoid FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out): Do not let the rising sentiment push you into hasty purchases at potentially inflated prices. Conduct Due Diligence: Always research thoroughly before investing, regardless of market sentiment. Set Stop-Loss Orders: Protect your investments from sudden downturns if the sentiment shifts rapidly. Remember, the index is a sentiment indicator, not a definitive buy or sell signal. It serves as a valuable tool to understand the prevailing emotions that drive market behavior. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index reaching 62 and entering the ‘Greed’ zone highlights a significant shift in the market’s emotional landscape. While this reflects growing optimism and potentially upward price momentum, it also signals a time for prudence. By understanding the factors that influence this index and exercising disciplined investment strategies, you can better navigate the evolving crypto market sentiment and make informed decisions. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) What does a score of 62 mean on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? A score of 62 on the Crypto Fear & Greed Index means the market has entered the ‘Greed’ zone. This indicates that investors are feeling optimistic and bullish, potentially leading to increased buying activity and higher prices. What factors influence the Crypto Fear & Greed Index? The index considers six factors: volatility (25%), market momentum/volume (25%), social media activity (15%), surveys (15% – currently paused), Bitcoin dominance (10%), and Google Trends data (10%). Is high greed good for the crypto market? While high greed can signal strong upward momentum, it can also indicate that the market might be overheated. Historically, periods of extreme greed are often followed by market corrections, making it a time for investors to exercise caution. How does Bitcoin dominance affect the index? Bitcoin dominance, which measures Bitcoin’s market share, is a key factor. A rising dominance can suggest investors are consolidating into Bitcoin, while a falling dominance might indicate a shift of capital into altcoins, both influencing overall market sentiment. Should I invest when the index shows ‘Greed’? The index is a sentiment tool, not an investment advisor. While ‘Greed’ indicates optimism, it’s wise to be cautious. Consider rebalancing your portfolio, taking profits, and avoiding impulsive decisions driven by FOMO. Always conduct your own research.

Which Of These Is A Wiser Investment In 2025",https://thecoinrise.com/desoc-ripple-or-cardano-which-of-these-is-a-wiser-investment-in-2025/,"As the crypto market evolves, investors are looking beyond hype and into real-world value. Ripple, Cardano, and the rising star DeSoc each offer something different: payments, infrastructure, and decentralized social media. But which one holds the smartest potential for 2025? Whether you’re drawn to utility, long-term growth, or user-driven innovation, this breakdown explores which of these three could be the wisest investment this year. XRP Hits Resistance As Analysts Warn Of A Pullback XRP has delivered solid gains in July, jumping over 55% and continuing its five-year streak of closing the month in the green. But recent signals suggest that the momentum may be cooling. The token reached just below its all-time high of $3.80, only to form what analysts now call a double top, a classic sign of potential reversal. Crypto analyst Tradersboat pointed out that XRP has shown signs of buyer exhaustion, along with a Break of Structure, indicating bears may be gaining control. Resistance at $3.60 has held firm, with rejection from that level adding weight to the bearish case. While another short-term push to $3.70 remains possible, the larger setup points to a potential drop below $3.40. Historically, August has been one of XRP’s weakest months, with the past three years showing an average 12% dip after strong Julys. This pattern might repeat if sentiment shifts. While XRP has strong fundamentals, timing could be critical for new investors deciding between Ripple, Cardano, or a rising player like DeSoc. Cardano’s Price Weakens But Network Development Stays Strong Cardano is facing renewed pressure after a sharp 15% drop sent its price down to around $0.77. The fall broke through key support zones, triggering stop-losses and sparking concerns of a deeper slide. Investor sentiment has cooled as the SEC paused Bitwise’s multi-asset ETF, which included ADA. That move, though involving a small allocation, echoed broader regulatory uncertainty now hanging over altcoins. On-chain signals aren’t helping the case either daily active users have dropped below 40,000, and DeFi TVL has slipped to $382 million. The MACD has flipped negative, and the RSI still leaves room for further downside. If $0.73 doesn’t hold, some traders expect a test of $0.68 . Yet, beneath the bearish short-term setup, Cardano’s fundamentals remain quietly strong. The network is still expanding, with over 2,000 active projects, new smart contract upgrades, and Layer-2 innovations like Hydra progressing. It may not be the flashiest right now, but Cardano continues to build. In a long-term portfolio, that development focus could still count for a lot. Why DeSoc Offers More Than Just Social Media DeSoc is quickly standing out as one of the most forward-thinking crypto projects of 2025. Unlike Ripple and Cardano, which are focused on payments and infrastructure, DeSoc is tackling something far more personal: how we communicate, share, and connect online. At its center is the SOCS token, with which DeSoc enables individuals to get the most out of their content, their information, and their digital identity. No more algorithm black boxes. No more data exploitation. Users can publish across platforms like Facebook and Twitter while still owning everything they share. Governance isn’t reserved for insiders. SOCS holders have real voting power to shape how the platform evolves. Creators will be able to increase their availability, place targeted advertisements, and be rewarded for engaging. Under the hood, DeSoc has already locked team tokens for 2 years and liquidity for 30, which is an indicator of long-term stability. Regular audits and a clear token allocation model build even more trust. While Ripple and Cardano focus on systems, DeSoc focuses on people. If you’re looking for a crypto investment with real-world use, community power, and long-term growth potential, DeSoc might be the wisest bet in 2025.

Unlike Ripple and Cardano, which are focused on payments and infrastructure, DeSoc is tackling something far more personal: how we communicate, share, and connect online. At its center is the SOCS token, with which DeSoc enables individuals to get the most out of their content, their information, and their digital identity. No more algorithm black boxes. No more data exploitation. Users can publish across platforms like Facebook and Twitter while still owning everything they share. Governance isn’t reserved for insiders. SOCS holders have real voting power to shape how the platform evolves. Creators will be able to increase their availability, place targeted advertisements, and be rewarded for engaging. Under the hood, DeSoc has already locked team tokens for 2 years and liquidity for 30, which is an indicator of long-term stability. Regular audits and a clear token allocation model build even more trust. While Ripple and Cardano focus on systems, DeSoc focuses on people. If you’re looking for a crypto investment with real-world use, community power, and long-term growth potential, DeSoc might be the wisest bet in 2025.

With billions flowing into meme coin projects, the digital asset class, once considered a joke, is now commanding serious attention from traders, influencers, and early adopters. Meme coins have transformed from fringe experiments to top cryptos to join in 2025, offering a rare combination of relatability, market energy, and presale upside that traditional tokens struggle to match. While the buzz centers around familiar names, the real momentum lies in what’s emerging now. The rising class of meme coins, including MoonBull ($MOBU), Floki ($FLOKI), Brett ($BRETT), and Popcat ($POPCAT), is redefining early-stage opportunity. These tokens have layered tokenomics, communities with viral potential, and accessible price points that invite both new and seasoned crypto investors. 1. MoonBull ($MOBU) MoonBull ($MOBU) is built for Ethereum users and meme coin enthusiasts who are focused on high-velocity gains and smart contract reliability. This token is laser-focused on rewarding early-stage participants through an advanced staking system and mystery token drops. Its DeFi integration gives it structural depth, while its meme branding taps into the viral power of internet culture. MoonBull’s roadmap is intentionally guarded, revealing insights only to whitelist members. This design rewards those who engage early and adds a layer of exclusivity that intensifies demand. What also makes MoonBull compelling is its Ethereum foundation, which ensures secure, scalable infrastructure for DeFi and token interactions. Here’s what whitelist members will gain: Access at the lowest token price Unlock secret staking rewards Receive bonus token allocations Get private insights into the roadmap These perks won’t be shared publicly. Once the allocation fills, that’s it. No resets, no retries. MoonBull made it to this list of top cryptos to join in 2025 due to its intelligent mix of exclusivity, strong tokenomics, and presale architecture that supports rapid early-stage growth. Learn from Missed Chances: What Hesitation Can Cost Picture an investor scrolling through forums in 2013, dismissing Dogecoin as just another online joke. Or someone briefly considering Shiba Inu before its parabolic rise, only to move on without action. These moments become cautionary tales repeated in hindsight. MoonBull’s whitelist offers a chance to change that narrative. It represents a rare gateway to early-stage entry – before the broader market awakens. While Stage One of the presale will eventually open to all, whitelist members receive private notice of the exact launch time and gain access before the public. The clock is ticking, and for those who understand that timing is everything, this may be the pivotal window that sets a portfolio apart. 2. Floki ($FLOKI) Floki ($FLOKI) gained its initial popularity due to its Elon Musk, but it has since matured into a robust ecosystem with utility and staying power. Its roadmap includes NFT gaming, metaverse expansion, and educational crypto platforms designed for new users. Built on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, Floki has positioned itself as more than just a meme – it’s a movement. Floki’s appeal lies in its trifecta approach: entertainment, education, and earning potential. The team has pushed hard into real-world use cases, with recent announcements around DeFi product integrations and community-driven philanthropic initiatives. Investors are drawn to Floki for its unique ability to balance humor and long-term strategy. It continues to build decentralized products, strengthening its case as one of the top cryptos to join in 2025. Floki earned its place on this list for blending meme culture with utility, delivering long-term vision and community leadership that attracts both new and experienced investors. 3. Brett ($BRETT) Brett ($BRETT) is a newcomer that leverages meme virality while integrating advanced token features for serious traders. What sets Brett apart is its dual-token economy and unique burn mechanics that support long-term price action. It thrives on cultural relevance, especially among Gen Z investors who resonate with its branding and storytelling. From limited NFT collections to gamified staking events, Brett is creating an ecosystem that is both fun and functional. The project’s team has consistently delivered on milestones, increasing confidence in its roadmap. The community behind Brett is rapidly expanding, thanks to creative airdrop campaigns and meme challenges that spread across TikTok and X. This gives it strong viral legs – a critical feature for breakout meme coins. Brett is included among the top cryptos to join in 2025 due to its creative burn economy, dual-token design, and cultural magnetism that translates into real market momentum. 4. Popcat ($POPCAT) Popcat ($POPCAT) blends nostalgia and innovation. Inspired by a viral meme, it has evolved into a fully-fledged ecosystem complete with liquidity rewards, staking options, and gamified user interactions. Built on the Solana blockchain, Popcat offers speed, scalability, and very low transaction costs – features that new users and day traders appreciate. One of Popcat’s biggest innovations is its meme-fueled GameFi engine. Users can earn rewards through mini-games, referrals, and content engagement. This model builds long-term user retention and continuous on-chain activity. In a time when attention spans are short and users seek quick ROI, Popcat provides both entertainment and income. Its branding is instantly recognizable, and its ecosystem is simple to navigate. Popcat secured its spot in this list of top cryptos to join in 2025 due to its GameFi integration, strong brand recall, and Solana-based performance that caters to active traders. Conclusion Based on the latest research, the top cryptos to join in 2025 include Moon Bull , Floki, Brett, and Popcat. Each of these projects brings a distinct blend of meme culture, smart tokenomics, and presale opportunity. However, MoonBull’s live whitelist access makes it the most time-sensitive opportunity among them. Whitelists remain a strategic way for investors to access new markets at rock-bottom prices before public trading drives up value. With MoonBull’s exclusive Stage One access and early staking rewards only available to whitelisted members, now is the time to act. The world is watching crypto adoption grow. Countries are adding Bitcoin to reserves, institutional players are entering meme territory, and early-stage tokens are offering unheard-of gains. This could be the tipping point for a new crypto wave, and MoonBull is leading the charge.

Joining the whitelist gives users early access to tokens at the lowest possible price, plus exclusive rewards and insights that are not made public before launch. How do meme coins generate value beyond hype? Modern meme coins integrate DeFi utilities, staking, and community-based rewards, offering real value alongside viral branding.

Is it safe to join the MoonBull whitelist? MoonBull uses a secure whitelist form and Ethereum smart contracts, offering reliability and transparency for users.
